The first step for starting the update before doing anything go to take backup
This is very important
With the AWS EC2 server upgrade suppose Ubuntu 16.04 to 18.04
Login to console
Select the required Ec2 and take his AMI.
After AMI creation is completed.
 ssh into that server
Here are 4 common commands we need to run
But first, check how much space we have for that run below command
 df -lh

Check available space if everything going smoothly maximum of 1 GB space need for the upgrade.
Now run the below command
1- sudo apt-get update
2- sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
3- sudo apt-get install update-manager-core
4- sudo do-release-upgrade
 When we run the last command our upgrade process will run.

Follow all instructions which are giving by the upgrade procedure and keep an eye on it every step
